# LanMessager
LAN Messenger is a cross-platform instant messaging application for communication over a local network. It does not require a server and is completely localised over a local network. It makes use of the Messenger Services bundled from Windows <br>
This is an effective solution for cheap and secure localised communication as sending and recieveing will be limited to local networks which will be wired under usual circumstances and will require physical access to be tapped into <br>
Be warned that this is a test application built using depreciated legacy Visual Basic .NET and functionality on newer operating systems and hardware is not guranteed
